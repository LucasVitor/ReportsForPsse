Psse Report Project.

	- The objective of this project is to create a program to read all PSSE .out files
		and creates an automatic pdf report with charts and a series of index 
		to help engineers to be more productive.
	
	- The first class of this project is called class Channels. The objective of the Channel class is to read 
		the channel's identifiers and classify the information in several groups that will be used in 
		futher analysis.
	
	- Now, I am working on a second class called Index.
		The objective of this class is to assess if one or more channels have any violations.
